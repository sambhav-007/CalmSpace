### Meditation Timer with Ambient Sounds

CalmSpace includes a meditation timer with customizable ambient sounds to help you relax and focus:

- **Ambient Sounds**: Choose from nature sounds, rainfall, ocean waves, or white noise to create the perfect meditation environment.
- **Ending Sounds**: Select a bell, singing bowl, or gong to gently signal the end of your meditation session.
- **Customizable Duration**: Set your preferred meditation length from 1-60 minutes.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the sound volume to your comfort level.

#### Custom Sound Files

You can customize the meditation experience by replacing the audio files in the `/audio` directory with your own:

- **Ambient Sound Files**:
  - `nature-ambient.mp3`: Nature soundscape
  - `rain-ambient.mp3`: Rainfall sounds
  - `waves-ambient.mp3`: Ocean waves
  - `white-noise.mp3`: White noise

- **Ending Sound Files**:
  - `meditation-bell.mp3`: Bell sound
  - `singing-bowl.mp3`: Tibetan singing bowl
  - `meditation-gong.mp3`: Meditation gong

**Note**: For best experience, ambient sounds should be 1-3 minutes long and set to loop, while ending sounds should be 3-10 seconds long.
